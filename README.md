DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:

END-TO-END DATA SCIENCE PROECT

📌 Overview This project is a complete end-to-end data science pipeline, from data preprocessing and model training to API deployment using Flask. It focuses on predicting whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical diagnostic features. The solution includes:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Model Training using Random Forest Classifier

Model Serialization (.pkl file)

API Development with Flask

Optional Web Deployment using Render

This project showcases the practical workflow of a real-world machine learning application—from raw data to a production-ready prediction API.

📈 Problem Statement Build a machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic features (e.g., glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.), and serve this model through a REST API that can be consumed by frontend applications, mobile apps, or other systems.

⚙ Pipeline Workflow

📊 Data Preprocessing Handle missing values
Standardize numerical features

Apply one-hot encoding to categorical variables (if any)

Split data into training and testing sets

🤖 Model Building Use RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn
Train the model on the cleaned dataset

Evaluate model accuracy

Save the trained model using joblib

🚀 API Development Build a Flask API with a /predict endpoint
Accept JSON input with 8 patient features:

Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age

Return a prediction (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes)

☁ Optional Deployment Host the API on Render.com
Publicly accessible via a POST request

✅ Features End-to-end ML pipeline: preprocessing → modeling → API

Modular and easy-to-read Python code

Model ready for production use

Clean and documented API for prediction

Deployable on cloud platforms like Render or Heroku

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used Python 3.x

pandas – Data manipulation

scikit-learn – Machine learning & preprocessing

joblib – Model serialization

Flask – Web API framework

Render – (Optional) Free cloud deployment
